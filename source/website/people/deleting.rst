Deleting People
===============

People can be deleted at any point by clicking the |delete_icon| icon next to the appropriate
person in the list of people on the relevant group page. After clicking and confirming the
modal prompt, the page will refresh and the person will be removed from the list.

**Deleting a person is a destructive action that cannot be undone. All associated devices
for that person will be deleted and revoked.**
