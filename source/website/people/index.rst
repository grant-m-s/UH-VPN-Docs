People are managed through the `website`_ and are contained within UH VPN groups. Within UH
VPN, people are used as a container for devices. This aims to replicate the real world
structure of people owning devices. This allows for reduced complexity when managing the
authentication structure of a VPN deployment. Administrators can easily view all devices associated
to a person and can perform "one touch" revocation for a person and all their associated devices.
