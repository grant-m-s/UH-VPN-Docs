Editing People
==============

People can be edited at any point by clicking the |edit_icon| icon next to the appropriate
person in the list of people on the relevant group page. After clicking, one is presented
with a page similar to that of person creation, except fields are pre-filled.

Edit the fields (described in `person creation`_) and then press the submit button to save.
