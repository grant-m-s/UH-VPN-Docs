Creating People
===============

People can be created by using the "Create New Person" button at the base of the list of people on
the relevant group page. One will then be presented with a list of fields to fill in as follows:

* **Name** : Name of the person one wishes to create.
* **Email** : Email address for the person in question. This is where OTP codes will be sent
  to allow for VPN profiles to be installed on devices.

Upon person submission, the above fields will be validated and submitted.
