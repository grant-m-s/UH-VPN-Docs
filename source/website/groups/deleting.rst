Deleting Groups
===============

Groups can be deleted at any point by clicking the |delete_icon| icon next to the appropriate
group in the `management page`_. After clicking and confirming the modal prompt, the page will
refresh and the group will be removed from the list.

**Deleting a group removes all servers, people and devices. It is a destructive action that
cannot be undone.**

Any subscriptions tied to a deleted group will immediately cancel and a final bill will be
taken at the end of the billing period.
