Obtaining API Tokens
====================

To use a server defined on the `website`_ with UH VPN Server software it is necessary to obtain an
API token for the server in question. To do this one needs to click the |key_icon| icon next to the
appropriate server in the list of servers on the relevant group page. After clicking, one will
be presented with a modal as shown below:

One simply needs to copy the token (shown in pink) and follow the `adding servers`_ instructions
in order to link the server software with the UH VPN API.

If a token has been compromised, the "Regenerate" button can be used to create a new token for the
server in question. **This will instantly revoke the old API token**
