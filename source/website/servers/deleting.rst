Deleting Servers
================

Servers can be deleted at any point by clicking the |delete_icon| icon next to the appropriate
server in the list of servers on the relevant group page. After clicking and confirming the
modal prompt, the page will refresh and the server will be removed from the list.

**Deleting a server is a destructive action that cannot be undone.**
