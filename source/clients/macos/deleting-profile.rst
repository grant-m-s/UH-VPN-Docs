Deleting Profiles
=================

Deleting VPN profiles within the macOS application is simple. First, one simply needs to click
the "Manage Profiles" button within the menu bar list:

The manage profiles window will then appear:

  :width: 500
  :alt: Manage profiles

Simply click on the profile you'd like to remove so that it highlights blue and then press
the "-" button in the bottom left of the window to remove the profile.

.. note::
    Deleting profiles cannot be undone and access to any UH VPN Servers associated
    with the group in question will be lost. New profiles must be issued from the UH VPN
    `website`_.
