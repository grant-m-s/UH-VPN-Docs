Connecting and Disconnecting
============================

Connecting and disconnecting to/from VPN networks is a very simple procedure and is done
solely from the menu bar.

Connecting
~~~~~~~~~~

To choose a base VPN profile to connect with select one from the Profile list:

  :alt: Profile Selection

Then choose a server to connect to that's associated with the group in question:

  :width: 350
  :alt: Server Selection

Once this is done, one simply needs to press the connect button at the top of the
menu bar to connect to their chosen server and group.

.. note::
    If this is the first time a connection is made, a pop up will appear asking
    permission to install VPN profiles, one must accept this in order for UH VPN
    to function correctly.

Disconnecting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once connected to a VPN server, one needs to simply press the disconnect button
at the top of the menu bar to completely disconnect from the VPN server in question.

.. tip::
    If one wishes to switch VPN profiles or servers quickly, it is possible to
    select a different profile or server whilst connected and UH VPN will
    dynamically reconnect to a chosen selection in real-time.
