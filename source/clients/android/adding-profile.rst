Adding Profiles
===============

Adding VPN profiles within the Android application is simple. One simply needs to click
the "Manage Profiles" button on the app, then press the "+" icon in the top right of
the modal alert. The user will then be prompted for a six digit code
which will have been received in an email. Once this is entered, the UH VPN profile
will then be securely downloaded to the device ready for use.
