UH VPN client applications are available free of charge for users to download and use with UH VPN
deployments. One simply needs to download the appropriate application for their operating system,
enter the one-time-passcode sent in an email and they're all set. Once the OTP code has been entered,
secure dynamic updates will occur to the UH VPN client application, meaning administrators never need
to issue manual updates to their end users. Furthermore, this method of deployment removes all risks
associated with manual VPN profile distribution as all exchanges are handled securely and automatically
via the UH VPN API.

This chapter of our documentation is designed specifically to support end users and provide simple
instructions on how to operate their application and connect to a chosen VPN server to establish
a secure connection.
