Migration from UH Enterprise/UH VPN Desktop
===========================================

With the introduction of UH VPN, the old "UH Enterprise"/"UH VPN Desktop" apps are
no longer supported and will no longer receive security and performance updates.

All clients should migrate to "UH VPN" on their relevant App Store, and request
new profiles from their Group administrator.

Notes for Apple Platform Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clients on Apple platforms may wish to wipe profiles from the old app before
uninstalling the old app.

- To do this on iOS, go to "Manage Profiles" and then delete all of the profiles
  one by one by swiping them to the left.
- To do this on macOS, open "Manage Profiles" and then click on the settings cog
  button at the bottom left of the table and press "Remove All Profiles".

If you did not remove profiles before uninstalling the old app, get your Group
administrator to revoke old profiles.  Alternatively on macOS:

1. Open Spotlight (``Cmd + Space``) and search for "Keychain Access".
2. Under the "login" Keychain on the left pane, look for an entry called
   "UH Enterprise Secure Profile Storage"
3. Delete the Keychain Entry by right clicking on it and pressing "Delete ..."

Notes for Android Platform Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Uninstalling the app will remove profiles from the device.

If on Android 10 ensure that "Keep XXX of app data." is **not** ticked when
uninstalling the app.

Notes for Windows Platform Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Disregard this information as a legacy Windows client was never produced.
