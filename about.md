# UH Enterprise

## Introduction
UH Enterprise is designed to be a fast, secure and convenient alternative to other large scale corporate VPN platforms. Most of the technology is derived from an early consumer VPN application called UH Net engineered by Ultra Horizon in 2017. UH Net was designed to accomplish three things:

**1. Speed:**
Be the fastest VPN system available by utilising cryptographic accelerated server hardware and VPN clients designed specifically to use the latest standards in network performance.

**2. Security:**
Utilise the most cutting edge cryptographic algorithms to ensure that the confidentiality and integrity of a user's data is never compromised.

**3. Indistinguishability:**
Combine a VPN protocol with masking technology to ensure that UH Net is usable anywhere in the world.

UH Enterprise has taken these three core principles and ported the technology to suit a corporate environment by enabling organisations to get all of the above benefits with the ability to also utilise:

**1. Custom Servers:**
UH Enterprise allows corporations to utilise VPN servers hosted in their offices/premesis to enable employees or remote workers to access their corporate resources anywhere in the world.

**2. White Labeled Applications:**
UH Enterprise offers the ability for corporations to easily customise user facing applications to match their branding.

**3. Centralised Authentication Mangement:**
All authentication and identity management is handled through an intuitive web-interface, meaning that access control can be performed anywhere in the world by authorized personnel.

**4. Easy Deployment:**
One of the main issues with current corporate VPN platforms is key/certificate distribution to authorized users. UH Enterprise employs a simple scheme based upon OTP (one-time passwords) to perform the initial cryptographic exchange; removing the need for complex standard operating procedures.
