## Overview

Authorised engineers are able to manage all aspects of their UH Enterprise installation at [https://uh-enterprise.com](https://uh-enterprise.com) from either a mobile or desktop. During installation of one's UH Enterprise infrastructure, relevant entities will be given account credentials and a tutorial for managing their deployment.

### Definition

UH Enterprise organisations represent a collective group personnel with access to a set of VPN servers. Every member registered in an organisation has access to all VPN servers defined within an organisation. Therefore, organisations should be constructed to reflect the relevant access permissions of users within a corporation.

### Admin Management

Every UH Enterprise organisation contains a list of administrators that are authorised to alter every part of an organisation including membership of other administrators. An admin can view the list of administrators at any point by clicking ![admins](https://uh-enterprise.com/static/images/icons/person.svg) next to any organisation one has access to.

#### Adding an admin

New admins can be enrolled by any organisation administrator by clicking the `Associate New Admin` button. Then one must enter the user ID of the new admin to associate them to the organisation in question. User ID's can be obtained from the [profile](https://uh-enterprise.com/profile) page in UH Enterprise.

#### Removing an admin

Existing admins can be removed at any time by clicking the ![admins](https://uh-enterprise.com/static/images/icons/trashcan.svg) next to an admin one wishes to remove. All access to the organisation for that admin will immediately be revoked.

### Organisation Management

Every UH Enterprise organisation has a set of associated properties which include:

- **Name:** The name of the organisation.
- **OTP Timeout:** Controls the expiry time of one time codes (seconds).
- **Logo:** Organisation logo for custom branding of mobile applications.
- **Primary Colour:** Primary colour used as the background colour in all mobile applications and email correspondence. The organisation logo will always be placed over this colour.
- **Secondary Colour:** Secondary colour used as the button colours in all mobile applications.

These properties are editable at any time by clicking ![edit](https://uh-enterprise.com/static/images/icons/pencil.svg) next to any organisation one has access to.
