3. Provide a thorough documentation platform to aid the use of UH Enterprise.

## Submitting a report:

Head over to [issues](https://github.com/ultrahorizon/UH-VPN-Docs/issues) and create a new one by using one of the pre-made templates to describe your problem/suggestion. One of our developers will then comment or roll out a fix if applicable.
